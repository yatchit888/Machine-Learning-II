(<Sentence: If you’ve noticed, this is how ML people make their machines learn through Reinforcement Learning.>, <Sentence: For example, when I showed you a lion picture, your brain asked the neurons who had seen it before.>, <Sentence: Every neuron will tune itself to pick up certain features like legs, tail, face, beard, and so on.>, <Sentence: And I hope she will not come to me running asking “Papa, what is Meural Metark?” again.>, <Sentence: And I have a strong feeling; she would ask me another stunning question sooner or later.>)

Gensim:
“Papa, tell me what stuff means and something means.” Cannot help evade a cute curious face, I said, “I am working on Neural Network.” Before I finish the statement, “Papa, What is a Meural Metark?” I gave up my stubbornness of avoiding her.
After all, neural network inside our brain helps us to learn new things in our life.
What I was actually doing here was teaching her neural network (brain) the features of a lion like exactly how Machine Learning Engineers would train the machine to learn new features.
After telling her the features of a lion, asked her “Can you draw these for me?” She happily drew almost a similar figure to that of a dog she drew before.
A dog will have features like face, body, legs, and tail.
A lion will have features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard.
The neurons grouped together with features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard forms a lion.
Once all the features are there, the neurons will send a signal that the picture you are looking at is a lion and not a dog.
Every neuron will tune itself to pick up certain features like legs, tail, face, beard, and so on.
Neural network is a group of neuron friends identifying lions and dogs.

Summa:
After all, neural network inside our brain helps us to learn new things in our life.
What I was actually doing here was teaching her neural network (brain) the features of a lion like exactly how Machine Learning Engineers would train the machine to learn new features.
After telling her the features of a lion, asked her “Can you draw these for me?” She happily drew almost a similar figure to that of a dog she drew before.
A dog will have features like face, body, legs, and tail.
A lion will have features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard.
Her neural network got aligned with classifying Dogs and Lions after some training.
Do you know what is the difference between a lion and a dog?” She said, “Yes.” I said, “This is called Learning.
How you learnt it is because of Neural Network inside your brain.” Now, a neural network is a collection of neurons that keeps switching on and off based on things you see, feel, hear and think just like switching on light bulb at our home.
For example, when I showed you a lion picture, your brain asked the neurons who had seen it before.
The neurons grouped together with features like face, body, legs, tail and a beard forms a lion.
Once all the features are there, the neurons will send a signal that the picture you are looking at is a lion and not a dog.
Every neuron will tune itself to pick up certain features like legs, tail, face, beard, and so on.
Ultimately, the neurons in your brain tell that it is a lion and not a dog.
In a few milliseconds, your brain identifies whether the picture is a lion or a dog.
Tanishi: Neurons
When I ask you to draw a dog, what are the features there?
Me: So, for a dog, the features are face, body, legs and tail.
If I ask you to draw a lion, what are the features?
So, neurons are inside our brain waiting for features.
Once the features are seen and a logical connection is established, neurons signals your brain that it is a lion.
Tanishi: Neurons
All neurons work together like your friends and identify lion and dog.
Neural network is a group of neuron friends identifying lions and dogs.

Which method is the best for summarization?
In my opinion, Summa is the best method for summarizing this article.

Why it is the best method?
Coherence and Flow:
Summa maintains a coherent and flowing narrative throughout the summary.
It effectively captures the essence of teaching neural networks by explaining the features of a lion and a dog.

Informativeness:
The Summa summarization provides informative content about the process of teaching neural networks, drawing comparisons between a lion and a dog. It includes details about how the neural network gets aligned with classifying dogs and lions after training.

Clarity in Learning Process:
Summa emphasizes the learning process through the neural network by describing the features of different animals and how the neurons work together. It communicates the concept in a clear and accessible manner, making it suitable for a wider audience, possibly including those less familiar with technical terms.

Engaging Dialogue:
The inclusion of the conversation between the speaker and Tanishi adds an engaging and relatable element to the summary. It helps in presenting complex concepts in a more accessible and conversational tone.

Application of Machine Learning Concepts:
Summa effectively integrates the application of machine learning concepts, comparing the process of teaching neural networks to how machine learning engineers train machines. It bridges the gap between a complex technical topic and a more relatable, everyday scenario.
