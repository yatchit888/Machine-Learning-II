So as\\n to perform a job in an organisation, one needs to be identified. In \\norder to identify \\nright person for a particular job, notification should be issued which \\ncontains job description ( duties and responsibilities) and \\nspecifications ( academic qualifications and physical qualifications). \\nSo as to verify the correctness of the candidates invited, they should \\nbe tested by the suitable selection methods for picking-up right person.\\n Subsequently selected \\ncandidates should be provided with the proper training for performing \\nhis duties &amp; responsibilities mentioned in the notification. Later, \\nassessment of \\nemployees\\' performance should be done to know whether employees are \\nperforming to\\n the desired standards set by the management. Accordingly employees \\nshould be rewarded or paid\\n for the job they did in the organisation and their safety in the job is\\n the responsibility of Hr manager or safety officer who should instruct \\nsafety measures for the employees and see that they are scrupulously \\nfollowed. Healthy and welfare measures are so-so important to keep \\nemployees happy and motivated which has direct impact on their \\nproductivity. Doing so all, maintaining proper and healthy rela</span><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0)\">tionships\\n between employees and management\\xc2\\xa0 avoids \\nconflicts which will effect the overall performance of the organisation.\\n Most important thing is adherence and not to ignore employment and \\nlabour laws which govern all the above said activities \\nfor a job.

To say in simple words Human resource \\nmanagement is evolved from the Personnel management. <b>Main principle of the Personnel management was to extract work from an employee for the remuneration paid.</b>\\n Employees during the \\nPersonnel management era were not given high priority in decision making\\n process and weren\\'t much allowed to interact with management. Personnel\\n management was more confined to the factories and the main \\nfocus of the Personal manager was to see that everything was in \\ncompliance with the labour laws or not but not much emphasis made on the\\n \\nmorale of employees. Employees were just treated as tools, obligation to\\n \\nthe organisation but not as the asset of the organisation, besides they \\nwere seen as\\xc2\\xa0 cost &amp; expenditure to company rather than capital and\\n investment. Personnel officers mostly used be disciplinary oriented \\ninstead of flexible and interactive with employees. Nurturing\\xc2\\xa0 of \\nemployees was not priority by the personnel managers and employees \\nperspective was ignored which means personnel managers rather than \\nunderstanding situation they used to be punitive if any error was \\ncommitted by employee. <br /><br />Human resource management see employees \\nfrom the perspective as a most valuable resources for the organisation \\nand they consider their employees as assets and capital for their \\norganisation. <a href=\"http://www.whatishumanresource.com/employee-motivation-introduction\"><u><b>Motivating employees</b></u></a> is a basic feature of human resource management in contrast with personal management. <b>Main principle of the Human resource management is \\nto see what should be given to an employee for extracting the desired \\nwork.</b> Hr Managers always encourage participation of employees in\\n decision making and their suggestions are most valued. Flexibility in \\nwork, welfare and Work life balance to employees is high priority for Hr\\n managers and they show much more concern towards employee issues. \\nAdoption of new policies and optimisation methods by the Hr manager are \\nwell encouraged and swift. The finest difference between Personnel \\nmanagement and Human resource management is integration and augmentation\\n of Information Technologies in the human resources management process \\nand functions for enhanced productivity and time savings as time is \\nmoney. All above Artificial intelligence and Roberts are taking over many Hr \\nfunctions ranging from employees recruitment, Testing, interviewing and \\nmany more. <br /></span></div><div><div style=\"display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto\"><div><div><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0)\"><br /></span></div></div></div></div><div><br /></div></div></font></div></div><div><div style=\"display:block;text-align:center;margin-right:auto\"><b><font size=\"6\">Who is responsible for human resource management?</font></b><br /></div><div style=\"display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto\"><br /></div><div style=\"display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto\">Human resource officer or Manager is responsible for human resource management in the organization.</div><div style=\"display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto\"><br /></div><div style=\"display:block;text-align:left;margin-right:auto\"><font color=\"#ff0000\" face=\"georgia, serif\">The HR Director</font> is a top-level manager responsible for the administration of all human resource activities and policies.

Supreme Court - Case law Jaipal Vs State of Haryana, AIR 1988 SC 1504, at 1509: The court has enunciated the doctrine as follows: The doctrine of equal work for equal pay would apply on the premises of similar work but it does not mean that there be  complete identity in all respects. If the two classes of persons do some work under the same employer, with similar responsibility, under similar working conditions, the doctrine of equal work equality would apply and it would not be open to the state to discriminate one class with the other in paying salary.

Collective bargaining:  The collective bargaining as a policy has been in vogue in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Australia, New Zealand and other countries. However in India the trade unions have more to learn from these countries to tackle the industrial problems.The phrase ‘Collective Bargaining’ is coined by famous authors  Sydney and Beatrice Webb  in their celebrated treatise on ‘History of Trade Unions’. Collective Bargaining is a method of determining the terms and conditions of employment and settling disputes arising from those terms by negotiating between the employer and the employees or their trade union. The very fact that the parties reserve the ultimate right to use economic weapons of strike and  lock out  helps in stimulating the parties to arrive at an agreement. The  Encyclopedia Americana states  that the American Federation of labour “insists upon the equity of workers in their right to bargain collectively with employers through representatives of their own choosing”.

management is the  process of recruiting ,   selecting ,   i nducting employees ,  providing orientation ,  imparting training and development ,  appraising the performance of employees , deciding  compensation   and  providing benefits ,  motivating employees ,   maintaining proper relations  with  employees and   their trade unions ,  ensuring employees safety,  welfare and healthy measures  in compliance with labour laws of the land and finally following the orders / judgements of the concern high court and supreme court, if any.  human resource management involves management functions like planning, organizing, directing and controlling it involves procurement, development, maintenance of human resource it helps to achieve individual, organizational and social objectives human\\n resource management is a multidisciplinary subject. it includes the \\nstudy of management, psychology, communication, economics and sociology. it involves team spirit and team work. it is a continuous process. human resource management as a department  in an organisation handles \\nall aspects of employees and has various functions like\\xa0  human resource planning , conducting   job analysis ,   recruitment  and conducting job interviews,  selection of human resources ,  orienting  , training,\\n compensating, providing benefits  and incentives, appraising, retaining, career planning ,  quality of work life ,  employee discipline, \\xa0 black out  sexual harassments ,  human resource auditing , maintenance of industrial \\nrelationship, looking after welfare of employees and safety issues , communicating with all employees at all levels and maintaining awareness of and compliance with local, state and federal labor laws. the historical rule of thumb for human\\n resource staffing requirements is one full-time professional human\\n resource person should be hired for every 100 employees. the actual ratio for a business can vary depending upon factors such as the degree of hr centralization, the geographic distribution of the employees served, the sophistication level of the employees, and the relative complexity of the organization. what is the importance of human resource? \\n behind production of every product or service there is an human mind, \\neffort and man hours (working hours). no product or service can be \\nproduced without help of human being. human being is fundamental \\nresource for making or construction of anything. every organisation \\ndesire is to have skilled and competent people to make their \\norganisation competent and best.  among\\n the five ms of management, i.e., men, money, machines, materials, and \\nmethods, hrm deals about the first m, which is men. it is believed that \\nin the five ms, \"men\" is\\xa0 not so easy to manage. \"every man is different\\n from other\" and they are totally different from the other ms in the \\nsense that men possess the power to manipulate the other ms. whereas, \\nthe other ms are either lifeless or abstract and as such, do not have \\nthe power to think and decide what is good for them.  why do we call it as human resource management? human:  refers to the skilled workforce in an organization. resource:  refers to limited availability or scarce. management: \\n refers\\xa0 how to optimize\\xa0 and make best use of such limited or scarce \\nresource so as to meet the organization goals and objectives. therefore,\\n human resource management is meant for proper utilisation of \\xa0available\\n skilled workforce and also to make efficient use of existing human \\nresource in the organisation. the best example in present\\xa0situation is, \\nconstruction industry has been facing serious shortage of skilled \\nworkforce. it is \\xa0expected to triple in the next decade from the present\\n 30 per cent, will negatively impact the overall productivity of the \\nsector, warn industry experts.  today many experts claim that machines and technology are replacing \\nhuman resource and minimizing their role or effort. however,\\nmachines and technology are built by the humans only and they need to be \\noperated or at least monitored by humans and this is the reason\\nwhy companies are always in hunt\\xa0 for talented, skilled and qualified\\n professionals for continuous development of the organization. therefore\\n humans are crucial assets for any organisation, although today many \\ntasks have been handing over to the artificial intelligence but they \\nlack judgement skills which cannot be matched with human mind. evolution of an

\\nautomation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional \\nmanufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to \\nextend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the \\nmost caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining\" -british theoretical physicist stephen hawking it\\n is undisputed fact that humans are being replaced by artificial \\nintelligence which are in the form of robots. but all jobs cannot be \\nhanded over to robots, to say in other words robots have its own \\nlimitations and all roles cannot be handled by robots.though\\xa0 british \\ntheoretical physicist stephen hawking,cambridge professor expressed \\nabout destruction of middle-class jobs due to raise of artificial \\nintelligence,he still felt that natural intelligence or need for \\napplication of human mind is inevitable in certain roles.  great quotations on human resource \"you\\n must treat your employees with respect and dignity because in the most \\nautomated factory in the world, you need the power of human mind. that \\nis what brings in innovation. if you want high quality minds to work for\\n you, then you must protect the respect and dignity. \"   ---mr n.r. narayana murthy, chairman emeritus, infosys ltd   . “our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. the human mind is our fundamental resource.”  - john f. kennedy ( 35th president of the united states ). human\\n resource management  definitions by  authors  many great scholars had defined human resource management in different ways and with different words, but the core meaning of the human resource management deals with how to manage people or employees in the organisation. edwin flippo \\n defines- human resource management as “planning, organizing, directing, controlling of \\nprocurement, development, compensation, integration , maintenance and \\nseparation of human resources to the end that individual, organizational\\n and social objectives are achieved.”  the national institute of personal management \\n (nipm) of india has defined human resources – personal management as \\n“that part of management which is concerned with people at work and with\\n their relationship within an enterprise. its aim is to bring together \\nand develop into an effective organization of the men and women who make\\n up enterprise and having regard for the well – being of the individuals\\n and of working groups, to enable them to make their best contribution \\nto its success”.  according to  decenzo and robbins ,\\n “human\\n resource management is concerned with the people dimension” in management. since every\\n organization is made up of people, acquiring their services, developing\\n their skills, motivating them to higher levels of performance and \\nensuring that they continue to maintain their commitment to the \\norganization is essential to achieve organsational objectives. this is \\ntrue, regardless of the type of organization – government, business, \\neducation, health or social action”.   evolution of  human resource management human resource management is evolved form the personnel management which was\\n erstwhile management system which used to manage employees. to know \\nevolution of personnel management one needs to see the history of \\ncenturies of research by great psychologists on human human \\nbehaviour and their response at particular situations. one among them was \\n elton mayo  who was a psychologists from the australia, did many experiments on \\nhuman behaviour at different situations in 1924. he\\xa0 strongly believed \\nin work life balance for improving productivity of workers and did \\nemphasis on human relations influence the productivity of workers and \\nfinally he has been regarded as father of human resources management.  going back to roots of evolution personnel management ,  robert owen \\n was \\nregarded as creator and originator for introducing reforms for workers \\nin his own lanark cotton mills. he created a principle of 8 hours day \\nwork, 8 hours rest and 8 hours sleep. owen identified the importance of \\nbetter working conditions at workplace and its impact on the \\nproductivity and efficiency of the workers. owen after implementation of\\n better working conditions at workplace, he observed change in the \\nproductivity of \\nhis workers as their efficiency increased. he in those\\xa0 olden days \\nimplemented many \\nsocial and welfare practices for his workers and saw his workers got \\nhappy, motivated and worked better. therefore he was referred as father \\nof \\npersonnel management. it\\'s believed that the first personnel management department (later \\nevolved as human resource management) began at the national cash \\nregister co. in the early 1900s, according to an human resource magazine article. \\nafter several strikes and employee lockouts, ncr leader john h. \\npatterson organized a personnel department to handle grievances, \\ndischarges, and safety, as well as training for supervisors on new laws \\nand practices. historical milestones in hrm d evelopment  >> the historical background of human resource management  >> father of personnel management  >>  the\\n u.s. office of personnel management (opm) is the world\\'s largest hr \\ndepartment. opm provides human\\n resource services for the federal governments \\nworkforce of nearly 2.8 million workers. it\\'s staff carry out the tasks \\nto recruit, interview, and promote employees; oversee merit pay, \\nbenefits and retirement programs; and ensure that all employees and \\napplicants are treated fairly and according to the law. father of personnel management   robert owen \\xa0 >> \\xa0 (14 may 1771 – 17 november 1858) r obert owen  raised  the demand for\\xa0\\xa0ten-hour day in year 1810, and instituted it in his new  lanark cotton mills. by 1817 he had formulated the goal of the\\xa08-hour  day and coined\\xa0 slogan 8 hours labour, 8 hours recreation, 8 hours full  rest.  w omen and children in the england were granted the ten-hour day in 1847.  the\\xa0  8-hour day movement forms part of the early history for the celebration  of the labour day, and the may day in many nations and cultures. father of human resource management george elton mayo  (26 december 1880 – 7 september 1949)  what is the purpose of human resource management?  the\\n purpose of\\n the human resource management is to make the job and deal with the job \\nholder (employee). so as\\n to perform a job in an organisation, one needs to be identified. in \\norder to identify \\nright person for a particular job, notification should be issued which \\ncontains job description ( duties and responsibilities) and \\nspecifications ( academic qualifications and physical qualifications). \\nso as to verify the correctness of the candidates invited, they should \\nbe tested by the suitable selection methods for picking-up right person.\\n subsequently selected \\ncandidates should be provided with the proper training for performing \\nhis duties & responsibilities mentioned in the notification. later, \\nassessment of \\nemployees\\' performance should be done to know whether employees are \\nperforming to\\n the desired standards set by the management. accordingly employees \\nshould be rewarded or paid\\n for the job they did in the organisation and their safety in the job is\\n the responsibility of hr manager or safety officer who should instruct \\nsafety measures for the employees and see that they are scrupulously \\nfollowed. healthy and welfare measures are so-so important to keep \\nemployees happy and motivated which has direct impact on their \\nproductivity. doing so all, maintaining proper and healthy rela tionships\\n between employees and management\\xa0 avoids \\nconflicts which will effect the overall performance of the organisation.\\n most important thing is adherence and not to ignore employment and \\nlabour laws which govern all the above said activities \\nfor a job. contravenes\\xa0 of employment laws will cost to the organisation\\n and its branding. hence the human resource management is like a guardian \\nangel for the organisation to sail smoothly and long-live. the ten \"cs\" of human resources management are: cost effectiveness, competitive, coherence, credibility, communication, creativity, competitive advantage, competence, change, and commitment. the ten \"cs\" framework was developed by alan price in his book \"human resource management in a business context\". why is human resource management important to all managers?  why are these concepts and techniques important to all managers? \\' perhaps it\\'s easier to answer this by listing some of the personnel mistakes you don\\'t want to make while man\\xadaging. for example, you don\\'t want to:  hire the wrong person for the job. experience high turnover  have your people not doing their best  waste time with useless interviews  have your company taken to court because of discriminatory actions  have your company cited under federal occupational safety laws for unsafe practices  have some employees think their salaries are unfair and inequitable relative to others in the organization  allow a lack of training to undermine your department\\'s effectiveness  commit any unfair labor practices difference between personnel management and human resource management. coming\\n to the crux of difference, personnel management is the seed and root for\\n human resources management. to say in simple words human resource \\nmanagement is evolved from the personnel management.  main principle of the personnel management was to extract work from an employee for the remuneration paid. \\n employees during the \\npersonnel management era were not given high priority in decision making\\n process and weren\\'t much allowed to interact with management. personnel\\n management was more confined to the factories and the main \\nfocus of the personal manager was to see that everything was in \\ncompliance with the labour laws or not but not much emphasis made on the\\n \\nmorale of employees. employees were just treated as tools, obligation to\\n \\nthe organisation but not as the asset of the organisation, besides they \\nwere seen as\\xa0 cost & expenditure to company rather than capital and\\n investment. personnel officers mostly used be disciplinary oriented \\ninstead of flexible and interactive with employees. nurturing\\xa0 of \\nemployees was not priority by the personnel managers and employees \\nperspective was ignored which means personnel managers rather than \\nunderstanding situation they used to be punitive if any error was \\ncommitted by employee.  human resource management see employees \\nfrom the perspective as a most valuable resources for the organisation \\nand they consider their employees as assets and capital for their \\norganisation.  motivating employees  is a basic feature of human resource management in contrast with personal management.  main principle of the human resource management is \\nto see what should be given to an employee for extracting the desired \\nwork.  hr managers always encourage participation of employees in\\n decision making and their suggestions are most valued. flexibility in \\nwork, welfare and work life balance to employees is high priority for hr\\n managers and they show much more concern towards employee issues. \\nadoption of new policies and optimisation methods by the hr manager are \\nwell encouraged and swift. the finest difference between personnel \\nmanagement and human resource management is integration and augmentation\\n of information technologies in the human resources management process \\nand functions for enhanced productivity and time savings as time is \\nmoney. all above artificial intelligence and roberts are taking over many hr \\nfunctions ranging from employees recruitment, testing, interviewing and \\nmany more.  who is responsible for human resource management?

employees  is one of the core functions of the human resource management. among all the motivating factors money is the very important primary motivating factor for any employee. providing right compensation for the work done by the employee will not only make\\xa0 employee feel happy, it will also make the organisation in complainance with employment laws of the land, if not it is unjustified and amounts to exploitation of employees which is against law. setting performance standards, measuring and evaluating the employees:  a  performance appraisal  is meant to help employees realise their \\nstrengths and shortcomings and receive a compensation accordingly. the very purpose of appraising the performance of employees is to evaluate and compensate accordingly. unless organisation sets performance standards to its employees, it cannot compare and measure employees actual performance with the standard performance. hr managers take performance gaps of employees for making decisions on employees with regard to rewarding them with bonus, profit-sharing, stock options and payment of incentives or not. these employee performance gaps will not only be considered for making decisions with regard to compensation but it is also considered for making decisions with regard to initiate corrective actions on said employees, promoting them to higher levels and if any employees performance gaps are high, such employees will be demoted, suspended or sometimes may be discharges from job.  counselling the employees  as a human resource manager, for understanding and helping people who have technical, personal and emotional or adjustment problems with an objective to reduce them, so that performance of employees are maintained at expected level or even improved upon.  recruiting prospective employees and selecting the best ones  from them \\nis one of the primary functions of human resource management. recruiting\\n is the process of inviting the people who were willing to join the \\norganisation and selecting best out of them is the crucial process in \\nwhich various selection tests are conducted. having best people in the \\norganisation will make that organisation is best in all the ways which \\nwould create employer brand that will help to attract talented people \\nand also make them to retain in the organisation long period of time. hr
