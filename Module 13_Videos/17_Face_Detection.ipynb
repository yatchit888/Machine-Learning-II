We have a 24×24 window which we slide over the input image, and we need to find if any of those regions contain the face. The job of the cascade is to quickly discard non-faces, and avoid wasting precious time and computations. Thus, achieving the speed necessary for real-time face detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "We set up a cascaded system in which we divide the process of identifying a face into multiple stages. In the first stage, we have a classifier which is made up of our best features, in other words, in the first stage, the subregion passes through the best features such as the feature which identifies the nose bridge or the one that identifies the eyes. In the next stages, we have all the remaining features.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an image subregion enters the cascade, it is evaluated by the first stage. If that stage evaluates the subregion as positive, meaning that it thinks it’s a face, the output of the stage is maybe.\n",

    "When a subregion gets a maybe, it is sent to the next stage of the cascade and the process continues as such till we reach the last stage.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now how does it help us to increase our speed? Basically, If the first stage gives a negative evaluation, then the image is immediately discarded as not containing a human face. If it passes the first stage but fails the second stage, it is discarded as well. Basically, the image can get discarded at any stage of the classifier"
